Required for 1.9.*/2.0
--------------------
***  Make sure you can override property values ****
- BUG: Installed app doesn't always seem to close
- BUG: If the user has an open blank file and it is deleted, then they keep it open, 
	then close without saving, they will not be prompted to save it. (see: Unsaved property)
- Get schema for MSBuild to give to XmlEditor, figure out how to switch between the schemas for nant and msbuild	
- Fix all UI events.  
	* Reload should be disabled when a new document is created	
	* If no documents are opened, close, save, save as, and reload should be disabled
	* Documents that are changes should have * next to the name
- If the file is readonly, make the editor readonly
	* What happens if the user opens the file, then changes the readonly flag?
- Make an UnSaved property on the Document instead of IsDirty?  In certain instances, like keeping the file open after
	it's been deleted, IsDirty doesn't really make sense (forces me to delete the contents so user is prompted for save)
- Make my own XmlEditorControl so I don't have to repeatedly modify sharpdevelop's code 
	(might not work because I had to modify more than the control)	
	
	
(DONE): Add basic MSBuild support	
	

For 2.1 and beyond
-----------
- Rename 
	* NAntDocument NAntGuiDocument
	* IBuildScript IScriptParser
	* NAntBuildScript NAntScriptParser	
- Figure out if there is a way to override the default behavior of the xmleditor sharpdevelop control to allow drag and drop of
  documents into an existing document. By default it will allow drag and drop of text, but with the drag-enter method it should be able 
  to handle different results for different dragged objects (text vs file)
- Dynamic help in the text editor with NAnt
- Find and replace
- Create options for LineNumbers, Folding, TabSpaces, etc...
- Consider using the Application.Idle event to update the display (enabled/disabled menu items and buttons) like Greg.XmlEditor, his code is not a tangled mess
- New NAnt project needs to be parsed and title should be Untitled*
- Port NAnt-Gui to SharpDevelop.Core?  Would thereby eleminate the need to use the text editor 
  control.  Would give access to syntax highlighting, code completion, add-in architecture, 
  find/replace dialog, etc...
- CODE Generation
	* Need to recurse and fill in the body of elements with sequences/choices
	* Create required attributes
	* How to implement file picker for filenames?
		- by file or dir on the end of the attribute?
	* What about booleans and other values?
	* How to determine if end tag is required	
	* Consider doing like NAntPad and creating a specific XSD that is easier to generate code from (supports bool, file and dir types)
- Rewrite the parser so that the location of elements is known
	* Add loadfile parsing
	* Add sysinfo parsing
	* Add regex parsing
	* Right-click target in tree view gives option to "Go to Target"
- Add a property window to change nant settings after nant-gui is loaded
- Add on the fly parsing back in (need to suppress parsing errors and allow an unsaved document to be parsed)
- Put save of buildfiles into THREADS (More difficult than it first appears)
- Create custom commandline options that make sense for msbuild, nant, and multiple tabs
	* Associate command line options for each file
- Validate build files 
	* show errors in an error window like VS.Net show errors
