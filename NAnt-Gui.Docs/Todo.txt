+ Dynamic help in the text editor with NAnt
+ Make NAnt-Gui work with other .Net framework versions besides 1.1
+ Version of NAnt-Gui for .Net 2.0
+ Only allow one copy of a file to load at a time
+ Put load and save of buildfiles into threads
+ Change the way that NAntBuildScript.cs:LoadNonProjectProperty:134 works.  Right now it adds all
  properties from the Gui regardless of whether the property's value has change.  Only propertys 
  with changed values should be added.
+ Clean up how property bag works.  AKA, the events should change the values of the properties and
  the Tag property of the propertyspec class can be removed as you don't need to store the actual 
  nant property in the propertybag.properties collection
+ Multiple tabs
+ Add a property window to change nant settings after nant-gui is loaded
+ Create custom commandline options that make sense for msbuild, nant, and multiple tabs
- Add SLiNgshoT tool window to tools menu
