- If you delete a property, or create a new one and save the file it doesn't reload the properties.
  This is true even if you reload the file.
- If a target is "called" or is depended on, you can't override the values of its properties 
  because it doesn't show up in the list of valid targets
- Tabs don't actually get closed (change a file, click new, close app, you'll get file not saved 
  dialog)
- If you sticky or unsticky the output box it loses it's formatting/highlighting
- If using a different regional setting for currency and numbers (ie: Italian) the targets window 
  docks with 0 height
- If you change a value on the propertygrid, then hit reload, the value doesn't change back to the 
  files value. If you hit reload again the value will change back.
