Tabs don't actually get closed (change a file, click new, close app, you'll get file not saved dialog)
Build doesn't enable when you save a new file
If you sticky or unsticky the output box it loses it's formatting/highlighting
FIXED: Hookup Leave event on outputbox and scripttabpage so the mediator can null reference _editCommand
FIXED: Targets reset when you build, so selected targets are reset
FIXED: Stop/Cancel build is never enabled (toolbar and menu)
FIXED: You can close the current build file, then stop becomes enabled
FIXED: No syntax highlighting on new files
